### finding counter examples: the knapsack problem

The knapsack problem is as follows: given a set of integers _S â‰¡ {s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>,...,s<sub>n</sub>}_, and a given target number _T_, find a subset of _S_ which adds up exactly to _T_. For example, within _S = {1,2,5,9,10}_ there is a subset which adds up to _T=22_ but not _T=23_.

Find counterexamples to each of the following algorithms for the knapsack problem. That is, give an _S_ and _T_ such that the subset selected using the algorithm does not leave the knapsack completely full, even though such a solution exists.

**(a)** Put the elements of _S_ in the knapsack in left to right order if they fit, i.e. the fit-first algorithm.

**counterexample:** _S = {1,5}_ and _T=5_

**(b)** Put the elements of _S_ in the knapsack from smallest to largest, i.e. the best-fit algorithm.

**counterexample:** _S = {1,5}_ and _T=5_

**(c)** Put the elements of _S_ in the knapsack from largest to smallest.

**counterexample:** _S = {4,3,2}_ and _T=5_

Watch Skiena lecture on [the knapsack problem](https://youtu.be/Cj73t5DGDWM?list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX32N0fVIyvn7ipWKNGmwpp&t=336) at his YouTube channel. In the lecture, Skiena makes the effort to refer to (a), (b) and (c) above as _heuristics_ instead of algorithms.
