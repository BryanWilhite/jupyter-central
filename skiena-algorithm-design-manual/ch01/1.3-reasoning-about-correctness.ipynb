    "After several examples leading to this conclusion, we are presented with the direct statement, “_recursion is [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction)_.” It follows that [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) is related to algebraic summations because variants of mathematical induction depend on algebraic sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch [an example of mathematical induction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMn5w4_ztSw) by Learn Math Tutorials on YouTube. This video suggests (indirectly) that because recursion _is_ mathematical induction and mathematical induction can be expressed in some kind of algebraic notation (often [sigma notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation#Capital-sigma_notation)) then we must be free to assert that recursion can be expressed by the same algebraic notation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">I’ve heard it said that a computer scientist is a mathematician who only knows how to prove things by induction. This is partially true because computer scientists are lousy at proving things, but primarily because so many of the algorithms we study are either recursive or incremental.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skiena then returns to our insertion sort algorithm [[1.0](./1.0.md)] and proves its correctness with mathematical induction. This algorithm is incremental or _iterative_. And there is a notable contrast between recursion and [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration#Computing). It might be useful to also mention that the ‘safest’ form of iteration is the _enumeration_ of a finite set because termination of the iteration is guaranteed. In the insertion sort algorithm, _s[]_, is that finite set.\n",

We now see that Θ is the “big Theta notation” or, worse, _[Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)_. This notation may not be necessary to express the correctness of an algorithm via mathematical induction but it is used traditionally to express the time efficiency of an algorithm (covered in Chapter 2).\n",
