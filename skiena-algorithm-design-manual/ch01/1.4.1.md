### Combinatorial Objects

Every “full stack” developer will _combine_ data by selecting it from some kind of database which often followed by sorting. Sorting is a kind of _permutation_ and selecting generates a _subset_ of data. These combinatorial forms are at the top of Skiena’s list:

* permutations (arrangement, tour, ordering, sequence)
* subsets (cluster, collection, committee, group, packaging, selection)
* trees (hierarchy, dominance relationship, taxonomy)
* graphs (network, circuit, web, relationship)
* points (sites, positions, data records, locations)
* polygons (shapes, regions, configurations, boundaries)
* strings (text, characters, patterns, labels)

>Modeling your application in terms of well-defined structures and algorithms is the most important single step towards a solution.

It must be noted that points and polygons are not listed in the [list of data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) referenced in [1.4.0](./1.4.0.md). The assumption here is that these structures are confined to [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry).

Also, a tree can be thought of as a unidirectional graph, limiting the input instances of relevant algorithms. [This observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)) is the domain of _graph theory_.
