### finding counter examples: the set cover problem

The _[set cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem)_ is as follows: given a set of subsets _S<sub>1</sub>_,...,_S<sub>m</sub>_ of the universal set _U_ = {1,...,_n_}, find the smallest subset of subsets _T_ ⊂ _S_ such that ∪<sub>t<sub>1</sub>∈T</sub>_t_<sub>i</sub> = _U_. For example, there are the following subsets, _S<sub>1</sub>_ = {1,3,5}, _S<sub>2</sub>_ = {2,4}, _S<sub>3</sub>_ = {1,4}, and _S<sub>4</sub>_ = {2,5} The set cover would then be _S<sub>1</sub>_ and _S<sub>2</sub>_.

Find a counterexample for the following algorithm: Select the largest subset for the cover, and then delete all its elements from the universal set. Repeat by adding the subset containing the largest number of uncovered elements until all are covered.

When _U_ = {1,2,3,4,5} and

_S_ = {{1,3,5}, {2,4}, {1,4}, {2,5}}

_S<sub>largest</sub>_ = {1,3,5}

_U_ - _S<sub>largest</sub>_ = {2,4}

_S<sub>largest</sub>_ = {1,3,5} + {2,4} = {1,2,3,4,5}

_U_ - _S<sub>largest</sub>_ = {}

proposed counterexample:

When _U_ = {1,2,3,4,5} and

_S_ = {{1,3,5}, {1,2}, {1,4}, {2,5}}

_S<sub>largest</sub>_ = {1,3,5}

_U_ - _S<sub>largest</sub>_ = {2,4}

_S<sub>largest</sub>_ = {1,3,5} + ?

There is no _largest_ number of uncovered elements among {1,2}, {1,4}, {2,5} All of these would return _1_.

**Assumptions:** the assumption here is that when Skiena uses the word _adding_ he is referring to set _union_ instead of a Minkowski sum [[ref](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/659134)]. Similarly, when the word _delete_ is used, a set _[difference](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/65544)_ operation (exclusion?) is assumed.
