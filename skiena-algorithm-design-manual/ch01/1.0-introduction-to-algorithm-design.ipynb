    "‚ÄúAn algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task.‚Äù The usefulness of the algorithm comes from an associated, well-specified _problem_‚Äîthat is not an _instance_ of the problem. One of the first challenges shown to me as a developer was being able to address a problem that can be reusable instead of ‚Äúhard-coding‚Äù for an _instance_ of this problem. It did not occur to me then in any systematic, historical/educational way that I was touching upon the subject of algorithms. It did not occur to me that the programmer‚Äôs ‚Äúintent‚Äù should have any relationship to algorithm design.\n",
