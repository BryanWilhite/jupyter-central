### Summations

This section is refresher course on algebraic summation in general and a reintroduction to [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) in particular. It definitely helps to mention that geometric series express summations of _infinite_ sets while finite sets are expressed by [geometric progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression), referred to in [1.2](./1.2.md).

Skiena punctuates this section with geometric series G(n,a) = Θ(_a<sup>n+1</sup>_) for _a_ > 1 where Θ(_a<sup>n+1</sup>_) = (_a<sup>n+1</sup>_ - 1)/(_a_ - 1). We now see that Θ is the “big Theta notation” or, worse, _[Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)_. This notation may not be necessary to express the correctness of an algorithm via mathematical induction but it is used traditionally to express the time efficiency of an algorithm (covered in Chapter 2).

A more formal term for Big O notation is _asymptotic notation_, referencing the [asymptote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote) of analytic geometry and reminding us that the sum of an infinite series is the _limit_ of that series (when such a limit exists, the series is _convergent_).
