### Summations

This section is refresher course on algebraic summation in general and a reintroduction to [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) in particular. It definitely helps to mention that geometric series express summations of _infinite_ sets while finite sets are expressed by [geometric progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression), referred to in [1.2](./1.2.md).
