### Induction and Recursion

After several examples leading to this conclusion, we are presented with the direct statement, “_recursion is [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction)_.” It follows that [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) is related to algebraic summations because variants of mathematical induction depend on algebraic sums.

Watch [an example of mathematical induction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMn5w4_ztSw) by Learn Math Tutorials on YouTube.

>I’ve heard it said that a computer scientist is a mathematician who only knows how to prove things by induction. This is partially true because computer scientists are lousy at proving things, but primarily because so many of the algorithms we study are either recursive or incremental.

Skiena then returns to our insertion sort algorithm [[1.0](./1.0.md)] and proves its correctness with mathematical induction. This algorithm is incremental or _iterative_. And there is a notable contrast between recursion and [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration#Computing). It might be useful to also mention that the ‘safest’ form of iteration is the _enumeration_ of a finite set because termination of the iteration is guaranteed. In the insertion sort algorithm, _s[]_, is that finite set.

>Mathematical induction is usually the right way to verify the correctness of a recursive or incremental insertion algorithm.

Skiena cautions us that “boundary errors” and “[cavalier] extension claims” (changing the problem instance input) are common types of inductive proof errors.
