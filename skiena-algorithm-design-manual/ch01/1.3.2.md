### Problems and Properties

Correctness of an algorithm requires a _problem specification_:

>Problem specifications have two parts: (1) the set of allowed input instances, and (2) the required properties of the algorithm’s output.

Skiena also uses the term _problem statement_ at the end of this section which can make one assume that _problem specification_ and _problem statement_ are the same thing.

The first part of problem specification uses the term “input instances” which can remind one of _problem instances_ mentioned earlier in this chapter. Without this reminder, there might be the temptation to fuse “input instances” with “test cases” which surely is beyond the scope of this discussion. Whatever these instances are, Skiena cautions us to not allow too many of them:

>An important and honorable technique in algorithm design id to narrow the set of allowable instances until there _is_ a correct and efficient algorithm. For example, we can restrict a graph problem from general graphs down to trees, or a geometric problem from two dimensions down to one.

Skiena encourages us to study problem statements from the “classic algorithm problems”; this is the first call to action to study the _history_ of algorithms.

>I encourage you to check out the problem statements for each of the 75 catalog problems in the second part of this book.
