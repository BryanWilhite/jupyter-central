### Recursive Objects

Skiena argues that the same structures listed under combinatorial procedures apply to recursive ones:

* permutations
* subsets
* trees
* graphs
* points
* polygons
* strings

This argument can be regarded as an opportunity to think recursively.

>Learning to think recursively is learning to look for big things that are made from smaller things of _exactly the same type as the big thing_.
