    "## Robot Tour Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot tour optimization problem is an opportunity to exercise algorithmic thinking though visualization (using the number line or a one-dimensional graph) and introduce the term, _[heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science))_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three possible procedures to solve this problem are introduced. The first two are eliminated by counter examples which demonstrates that _contradiction_ plays a dominant role in algorithmic thinking. The last procedure is correct but it is astronomically slow, demonstrating correctness without efficiency. Skiena then reveals that the Robot Tour Optimization problem is a child of the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).\n",
    "\n",
    ">There is a fundamental difference between _algorithms_, which always produce a correct result, and _heuristics_, which may usually do a good job but without providing any guarantee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch Skiena lecture on [robot tour optimization](https://youtu.be/A2bFN3MyNDA?list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX32N0fVIyvn7ipWKNGmwpp&t=2333) at his YouTube channel. In the lecture, he introduces the term _[NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness)_ to describe correctness without efficiency or no fast solution.\n",
    "\n",
    ">I prefer to describe the ideas of an algorithm in English, moving to pseudocode to clarify sufficiently trick details of the algorithm. â€”Steven S. Skiena\n"
