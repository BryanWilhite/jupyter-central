### Demonstrating Incorrectness

Here is where Skiena introduces the term _counter-example_. “Good counter-examples have two important properties”:

* verifiability
* simplicity

“Hunting for counter-examples is a skill worth developing… Here are some techniques to aid your quest:”

* Think small.
* Think exhaustively [which is quite possible when thinking small].
* Hunt for the weakness.
* Go for a tie.
* Seek extremes.

>Searching for counterexamples is the best way to disprove the correctness of a heuristic.

The counter-example _should_ have a relationship with a failing automated test. In other words an automated test can represent an heuristic counter-example.
