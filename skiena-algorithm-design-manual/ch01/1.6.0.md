## War Story: Psychic Modeling

We are presented with a kind of _[set cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem)_ from the alleged needs of lottery “psychics.”

* a standard lottery ticket consists of six numbers (selected out of 1 to 44)—this is the universe _U_
* the “psychic” can visualize 15 numbers (selected out of 1 to 44)—this is the collection of sets _S_ with 15 sets of length 6
* four of the 15 numbers will be on the winning ticket

>It was indeed a special instance of set cover, completely specified by four numbers:
>
>1) the size _n_ of the candidate set _S_ (typically _n_ ≈ 15)
>2) the number of slots _k_ for numbers on each ticket (typically _k_ ≈ 6)
>3) the number of psychically-promised correct numbers _j_ from _S_ (say _j_ = 4)
>4) and finally, the number of matching numbers _l_ necessary to a prize (say _l_ = 3)

For _n_ = 5, _j_ = _k_ = 3, and _l_ = 2:

_U_ = {1,2,3,4,5}

_S_ = {{1,2,3},{1,4,5},{2,4,5},{3,4,5}}

The Skiena algorithm for this problem involves _ranking_ a vector (which is a one-dimensional matrix) which should lead one to [ranking a matrix in linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)).
