## Reasoning about Correctness

Here we are presented with mathematical or formal proofs and how we are _not_ going to concentrate on them. This might have been an opportunity to introduce the relatively exotic subject of _[proof theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory)_. [Robert Harper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Harper_(computer_scientist)) places proof theory in his “holy trinity” of computer science:

* proof theory (logic)
* type theory (programs)
* category theory (algebra)

[Watch Robert Harper lecture](https://t.co/5118rTpLJn) about this trinity on YouTube. Only Skiena could tell us (without knowing the rest of book) whether we are going to stay under programs and algebra in Harper’s trinity—but some distance away from proof theory has been explicitly established.
