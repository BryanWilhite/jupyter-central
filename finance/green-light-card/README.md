# Greenlight Card Plan

I feel very fortunate to share this interest-payment schedule developed for my youngest child. Should any of my other children happen upon these documents just remember that (i) your dad was too poor to even think like the stuff written here and/or (ii) your mother was ‘actively unhelpful’ during the critical years wherein stuff like this could be established by the _real_ father.

Most obviously, the idea of using a mobile-device app to provide children with a connection to finances (and their non-custodial father) was not even possible when, say, my eldest son was 13 years old. For the record, by the way, I do not think children should have mobile devices—when these children have the privilege of living in a traditional communal situation of sustainable vitality.

Also, it may help to mention that the [Greenlight Card](https://www.greenlightcard.com/) people added an interest payment feature to the app a few years after this plan started with my daughter.

Anyway, the plan here is simple:

1. calculate the average daily balance every month
2. every three months take the sum of the average daily balance
3. take 10% of that sum and add it to Greenlight savings

This savings is meant for my daughter to secure her first consumer credit card with cash when she turns 18 years of age. But first this experience intends to provide my daughter with:

- an example of how one can be incredibly inaccurate but incredibly consistent
- a sometimes painful but rewarding relationship with delayed gratification
- a lonely but exceedingly profitable relationship with self-organization
- a direct relationship with [compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest)
- ideally, an introduction to what my father calls [_longsuffering_](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/search.cfm?Criteria=longsuffering&t=KJV#s=s_primary_0_1) and keeping one’s word

This experience also conceals the real world of interest payments from my daughter. She will have to find out about [negative interest rates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/05/18/negative-interest-rates-explained-how-could-they-affect-you/#674e77a27b46) later!

## speaking of ‘incredibly inaccurate’…

My ledger is not balancing correctly with Greenlight:
