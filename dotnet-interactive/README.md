# .NET Interactive

>.NET Interactive [[GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive)] takes the power of .NET and embeds it into your interactive experiences. Share code, explore data, write, and learn across your apps in ways you couldnâ€™t before.

.NET Interactive takes the the scripting versions of C# and F# and rolls them up into a Jupyter Notebook kernel (with PowerShell scripting of course).

For more information, [my notes](./dotnet-interactive.ipynb) are here.
