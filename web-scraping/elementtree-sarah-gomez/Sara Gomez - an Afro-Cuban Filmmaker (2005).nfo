A woman of great intelligence, independence and generosity, she was a revolutionary filmmaker with intersecting concerns about the Afro-Cuban community and the value of its cultural traditions, womenâ€™s issues, and the treatment of the marginalized sectors of society. Through archival footage of her works and interviews with her children and husband Germinal Hernandez, cast members of her best-know film De cierta manera, as well as colleagues and friends, we get closer to a filmmaker who invented new landscapes and brought together opposite worlds.</plot><genre>documentary</genre><country>United States</country><director>Alessandra Muller</director><year>2005</year><actor><name>Sara Gomez</name><role>herself</role><thumb>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d5/Sara_G%C3%B3mez%2C_Cuba%E2%80%99s_First_Female_Director_%26_First_Afro_Female_Filmmaker_in_the_Americas_Photo_Courtesy_ICAIC.jpg</thumb></actor></movie>
