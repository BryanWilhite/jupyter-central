<episodedetails><title>Scandinavia: The Forgotten Front</title><plot>The vicious 14-week war between the Finns and the Russians ended in March 1940 when the Finns finally surrendered a large part of its territory to the Soviet invaders. 500,000 were evacuated from the Karelian isthmus, the scene of the war's most terrible fighting. It was a hollow victory, since for much of the war the Russians took a drubbing from the determined and resourceful Finns, who organised the defence of their country brilliantly. It is believed that one million Russians lost their lives during the fighting and the weaknesses of the Red Army were exposed for the world to see. Hitler was suitably encouraged, for he had already determined on the invasion and conquest of his erstwhile allied partner. Meanwhile, during the early months of the war, Hitler became increasingly aware of the potential threat of Norway and mounted the world's first airborne invasion there in February 1940. At the same time, German Forces invaded Denmark. Over the next few years, the horrors and intrigues of the Quisling government in Norway unfolded amidst determined Norwegian resistance.</plot></episodedetails>
