<episodedetails><title>Siege at the Khe Sahn</title><plot>Covers in great detail the largest battle of the war around the US Marine base at Khe Sanh, including the surrounding hill battles and the many B-52 strikes. This episode is the highlight of the series for me, it covers this battle better than any other documentary I've seen. A lot of the battle was artillery fire being exchanged on both sides and this episode covers exactly where the artillery pieces were placed and shows how the US was able to resupply its troops on the nearby hills while under heavy fire, it was very well done.</plot></episodedetails>
