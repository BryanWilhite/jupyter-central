This was her longest, most gruelling battle—lasting over two decades, it threatened to tear apart both Elizabeth and her kingdom. In the end, it would force her to make the hardest decision of her life.</plot><genre>documentary</genre><country>United Kingdom</country><director>Renny Bartlett</director><year>2016</year><actor><name>Helen Bradbury</name><role>Elizabeth I</role><thumb>https://cdn.celebsagewiki.com/profile/10/helen-bradbury.jpg</thumb></actor><actor><name>Beth Cooke</name><role>Mary, Queen of Scots</role><thumb>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Y0MDY4NmEtNzZmMS00NDcyLWIxNDktMjJmOTU5ZGY0MzM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI1OTc4NjA@._V1.jpg</thumb></actor></movie>
