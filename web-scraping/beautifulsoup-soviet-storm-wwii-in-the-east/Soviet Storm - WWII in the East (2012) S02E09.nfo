<episodedetails><title>War Against Japan</title><plot>In August 1945 the Red Army launched an overwhelming assault against Japanese-occupied Manchuria. It came on the same day that Japan suffered its second devastating nuclear attack, and proved instrumental in forcing the Japanese leadership to recognise that the war was lost. This is the fascinating untold story of the Red Army’s last campaign of World War Two, which included the last battle of the war - a bloody amphibious landing on the remote Kurile Islands almost a week after Japan’s surrender.</plot></episodedetails>
