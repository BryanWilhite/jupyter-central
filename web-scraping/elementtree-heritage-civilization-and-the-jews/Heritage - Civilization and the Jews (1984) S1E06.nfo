<episodedetails><title>ROADS FROM THE GHETTO (1789 — 1925)</title><plot>"Roads from the Ghetto" covers the struggles for the enfranchisement of the Jews and other minorities. In country after country for a brief time following the conquest of Napoléon — in Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary — medieval restrictions were swept aside and political rights were granted to all. For about a decade, until the collapse of Napoléon's empire, Jews were offered political equality and citizenship in the nations of Europe. The program also documents the infamous Dreyfus case in France, which served as springboard for "anti-Semitism"; the birth of Zionism and other modern expressions of Judaism; and the waves of Jewish emigration from Europe toward the end of the nineteenth century.</plot></episodedetails>
