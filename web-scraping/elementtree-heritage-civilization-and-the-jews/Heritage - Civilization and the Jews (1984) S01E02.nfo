<episodedetails><title>THE POWER OF THE WORD (586 B.C. — 72 C.E.)</title><plot>"The Power of the Word" begins in the abundant land of Babylon, where the exiled Jews of Judah had settled after the conquest of Jerusalem by the Babylonian forces. They had their own vision. They came to believe more profoundly than ever before that there was a universal dimension to their faith — that their God extended to all lands, to all times. "It was here in Babylon that Jewish scribes compiled writings they had brought from Judah — the history, the laws, the legends of the Jewish people and combined them with what had been passed down by word of mouth to form the first five books of the Bible — the Torah," explains Mr. Eban in the program.</plot></episodedetails>
