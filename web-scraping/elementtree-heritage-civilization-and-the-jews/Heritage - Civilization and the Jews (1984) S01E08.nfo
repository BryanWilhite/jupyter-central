<episodedetails><title>OUT OF THE ASHES (1919 â€” 1947)</title><plot>"Out of the ashes comes the understanding that no one's life can be guaranteed without constant struggle. Belief in the ultimate ability of humankind to overcome the darkest, most brutal of forces is the light which must carry us forward," declares Ambassador Eban in this haunting hour which attempts to illuminate the universal meaning of the Holocaust. Through dramatizations of the anguished words of victims of Nazi terrorism and through rare archival photographs and moving film footage, "Out of the Ashes" paints a picture of life in the European "shtetl" and later in the concentration camps. "Out of the Ashes" attempts to treat the Holocaust not only as a devastating memory of yesterday, but as a profound challenge for today.</plot></episodedetails>
