<episodedetails><title>THE GOLDEN LAND (1654 — 1930s)</title><plot>"The Golden Land" describes one of the most important and exciting chapters in Jewish history — the relationship between the United States and the Jewish people. Never before had a country accepted Jewish people with so little resistance. And never before in their 3,000-year history had Jews made such a significant contribution to the shaping and growth of a country. With the wave of pogroms of Russia and the rise of anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe in the late 1800s, a new chapter in the American Jewish story was written. Some two million Jews from all over Eastern Europe converged on the United States from 1880 to 1920.</plot></episodedetails>
