<episodedetails><title> INTO THE FUTURE (1880 â€” 1990s)</title><plot>"Into the Future" picks up the thread of Jewish history after World War II and the devastating effects of the Nazi Holocaust. Although many of the survivors found a haven in the United States, there were still many borders closed to Jewish refugees. Their only hope rested in the Middle East, in Palestine, part of the disintegrating British Empire. This "Heritage" episode includes interviews with various Israelis, some of whom emigrated to Palestine in the early years of the twentieth century, as well as some who settled in Israel following World War II. The program examines Israel's relationship to American Jews and modern Jewish communities elsewhere in the world. It reviews the distribution and the state of Jews and addresses the long-rage issues which confront them.</plot></episodedetails>
