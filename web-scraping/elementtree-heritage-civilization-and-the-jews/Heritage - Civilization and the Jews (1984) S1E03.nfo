<episodedetails><title>SHAPING OF TRADITIONS (30 â€” 732 C.E.)</title><plot>Ambassador Eban continues the story of the Jewish people, when Rome was the ruler of the world and the Jews lived scattered throughout the Mediterranean. Wherever they lived, communities of Jews continued to obey the laws of their own faith. By the year 135, the Roman armies of the emperor Hadrian had crushed the land of Judea. For several years, the teaching of Judaism became a capital crime. "The Shaping of Traditions" chronicles the decline of the Roman Empire, a process extending over four centuries, and shows how the Jewish faith continued to survive throughout these turbulent years.</plot></episodedetails>
