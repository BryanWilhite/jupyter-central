The series is hosted by former Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Abba Eban, who describes it as "a celebration of our common humanistic and moral heritage, explored through the mysteries of preservation, renewal, and resonance of the Jewish people." From the stony heights of Sinai to the shores of the Dead Sea, from a Greek amphitheater in Delphi to the Forum of ancient Rome, out of the ashes of concentration camps to the rebuilt cities and villages of Israel, "Heritage" brings to life the long and complex history of the Jews and their centuries-old interaction with the rest of Western civilization.</plot><thumb aspect="poster">https://emergencysurvival.info/img/heritage-civilization-and-the-jews-dvd-2.jpg</thumb><thumb aspect="poster" season="1" type="season">https://emergencysurvival.info/img/heritage-civilization-and-the-jews-dvd-2.jpg</thumb><fanart /><genre>documentary</genre><actor><name>Abba Eban</name><role>himself</role><thumb>https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/israeli-diplomat-and-politician-abba-eban-was-the-israeli-ambassador-picture-id543724652?k=6&amp;m=543724652&amp;s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;h=x7xfeWAzll_dLW0V3qeE1N-icy2OJvwwahRdLxw73c0=</thumb></actor></tvshow>
