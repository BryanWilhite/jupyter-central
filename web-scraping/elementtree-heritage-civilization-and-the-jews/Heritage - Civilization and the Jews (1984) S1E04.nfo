<episodedetails><title>THE CRUCIBLE OF EUROPE (732 â€” 1492)</title><plot>In Islamic Spain, despite periodic persecution, the Jews found a "golden age" in the tenth and eleventh centuries. "In Spain, for more than two centuries, Arabs and Jews lived together, side by side, bound to each other despite differences, by a common love of beauty and knowledge, poetry and music, art and philosophy," explains Mr. Eban. "The Crucible of Europe" then travels to Northern Europe, where the Latin Church was gradually consolidating its authority. The program looks at the Spanish Inquisition and the disastrous course of events that followed as the Jewish people found themselves trapped in a politically and economically untenable position.</plot></episodedetails>
