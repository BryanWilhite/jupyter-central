<episodedetails><title>Edgar Allan Poe: Buried Alive</title><plot>A profile of Edgar Allan Poe (1809-49), who's best known for his Gothic horror tales and narrative poem "The Raven." He also created the detective fiction genre with "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" in 1841; and published more comedies than horror. After Poe's untimely death, a literary rival penned a high-profile, decidedly unflattering obituary that made him sound like one of the narrators of his horror tales. The truth, of course, is far more complex. Here, Poe experts correct the record.</plot></episodedetails>
