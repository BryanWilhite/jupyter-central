<episodedetails><title>La Maison de fer</title><plot>Architecture as an object? Learn from a building, stay as close to architecture as possible, constantly return to the materiality of the choices that this implies. The volume, the organization of space and light, how we are guided through a space, all these elements characterize the approach proposed by this series of films. This episode is devoted to the Van Eetvelde Hotel in Brussels, built by Victor Horta, one of the forerunners of Art Nouveau.</plot></episodedetails>
