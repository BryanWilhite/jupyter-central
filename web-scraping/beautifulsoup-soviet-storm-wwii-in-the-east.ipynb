On the 8th of September 1941 the Germans reached Lake Ladoga and the city turned out to be cut off from the 'mainland'.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath from starvation began to threaten the population of Leningrad. The ships of the Baltic Fleet, anti-aircraft guns, artillery and troops of the Red Army defended the city and the 'life road' that became operable after the frosts. Multiple attempts of the Soviet Command to break though the encirclement failed one after another.\",\n",
