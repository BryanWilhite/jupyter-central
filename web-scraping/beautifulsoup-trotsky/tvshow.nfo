For a quarter of an hour they shoot at the house, but by an incredible coincidence, Trotsky and his wife survive. Having lost during the eleven years of expulsion almost all close ones and relatives, Trotsky understands: his eternal enemy, Stalin, will continue to pursue him until the end of his days. He decides to leave a political testament, for the first time to tell in full and sincerely how a Jewish young man managed to become a prophet of the new world and destroy the largest empire. To write his memoirs, Trotsky invites his ideological opponent – a Canadian journalist sympathetic to Stalin — to convert him into his faith, so that he in turn can convert the whole mankind.</plot><thumb aspect="banner">https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/graphical/5c8de44196ea4.jpg</thumb><thumb aspect="poster">https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/posters/5b510d2263ec0.jpg</thumb><fanart /><genre>Drama</genre><genre>History</genre><genre>Mini-Series</genre><genre>Thriller</genre><actor><name>Konstantin Khabensky</name><role>Leon Trotsky</role><thumb>https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/actors/454040.jpg</thumb></actor><actor><name>Olga Sutulova</name><role>Natalia Sedova</role><thumb>https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/actors/460111.jpg</thumb></actor><actor><name>Evgeniy Stychkin</name><role>Vladimir Lenin</role><thumb>https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/actors/460112.jpg</thumb></actor><actor><name>Max Matveev</name><role>Frank Jackson (Ramon Mercader)</role><thumb>https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/actors/472607.jpg</thumb></actor><actor><name>Anastasiya Meskova</name><role>Larisa Reysner</role><thumb>https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/actors/472610.jpg</thumb></actor></tvshow>
