The continent of Africa has a long, complex history, and its people built civilizations which rivalled those that  existed anywhere else in the world. However, much of the continent’s history is not widely known, and what we are presented with often projects a distorted and partial picture. Sudan-born Zeinab travels to all four corners of Africa, interviewing African  historians, archaeologists, and citizens whose accounts and stories paint a vivid picture of their continent’s past and how it informs their present lives.  It is a series that will inform, educate and entertain — Africa’s history told by Africans themselves.</plot><thumb aspect="banner">https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/series/357242/banners/5f6010c847d31.jpg</thumb><thumb aspect="poster">https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/series/357242/posters/5f6001037411b.jpg</thumb><fanart><thumb dim="1280x720">https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/series/357242/backgrounds/5ea29718b0446.jpg</thumb></fanart><genre>Documentary</genre><genre>History</genre><actor><name>Zeinab Badawi</name><role>Host</role><thumb>https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/person/7893869/5ea297c1f3e3d.jpg</thumb></actor></tvshow>
