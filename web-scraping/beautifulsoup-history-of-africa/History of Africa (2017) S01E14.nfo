<episodedetails><title>The Golden Stool</title><plot>In this episode,  Zeinab Badawi travels to Ghana and Cote D’Ivoire to  find out about the Asante people and their kingdom. We examine the history, myths and legends of the Asante people.   We attend the Akwasidae, a colourful festival where the King of the kings of the Asante - known as the Asantehene - has his gold regalia on full display as a way of projecting wealth and prestige. And we hear about the great Asante queen who led the resistance against the invading British and hid the Asante’s most valued and sacred possession: the Golden Stool. The Asante serve as an example of how despite decades of colonial rule, Africans maintained their traditions and continue to revel in and perpetuate their heritage and customs.</plot></episodedetails>
