    "The episode data and media file rendering present the following challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "**One episode can contain two shows.** The table is listing duplicate episodes because one episode can span two shows (e.g. S01E15 has shows “Future Dib” and “Mysterious Mysteries”).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Opening credits do not appear for the second show.** Using something like [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/) to split the DVD files into separate episodes will not work here because opening credits do not appear for the _second_ show. The intention of the DVD authors were to keep two shows under one episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two known ways to meet these challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. add multi-part episodes by declaring multiple `<episodedetails>` XML blocks in succession in the same `*.nfo` file [📖 [docs](https://kodi.wiki/view/NFO_files/Episodes)] (which makes invalid `standalone` XML documents—not a concern for Kodi) like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<episodedetails>\n",
    "    <title>[first show title]</title>\n",
    "    <plot>[plot for first show]</plot>\n",
    "</episodedetails>\n",
    "<episodedetails>\n",
    "    <title>[second show title]</title>\n",
    "    <plot>[plot for second show]</plot>\n",
    "</episodedetails>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. make a valid `standalone` XML document that will not look great in Kodi like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\" ?>\n",
    "<episodedetails>\n",
    "    <title>Episode [n]</title>\n",
    "    <plot>[first show title]: [plot for first show] // [second show title]: [plot for second show]</plot>\n",
    "</episodedetails>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make the invalid XML documents by looping through the `table` rows with the following plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. get `episode_data` without plot information\n",
    "2. test one episode page to discover how to get plot information\n",
    "3. loop through `episode_data` to set plot information\n",
