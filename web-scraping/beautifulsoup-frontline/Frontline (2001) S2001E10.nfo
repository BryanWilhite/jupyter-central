The state's power crunch has affected everyone from homeowners and small businesses to the big-business consumers of electricity who originally pushed for deregulation. Now, the state's largest utility, PG&amp; E, has filed for bankruptcy.

And could other states face similar energy shortages?</plot></episodedetails>
