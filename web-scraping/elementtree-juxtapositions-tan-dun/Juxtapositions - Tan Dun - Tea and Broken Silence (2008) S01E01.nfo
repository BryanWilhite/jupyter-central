<episodedetails><title>Tea</title><plot>Film 1 : Tea recounts how chinese composer Tan Dun wrote the opera Tea, a tragig love story set against the background of the Japanese tea ceremony. He combines eastern and western composition techniques with musical ideas to create a unique sounding fusion between two great musical traditions. The Tea opera is the door to this journey into the mystical world of Chado, the Way of Tea. A world in which the ultimate objective is, as Tan Dun himself staes, "to hear colour and see sound". Beautifully crafted by Franck Scheffer, Tea includes interviews of Tan Dun, Librettist Xu Ying and Director Pierre Audi, as well as performances with the NHK Symphony Orchestra and the Dutch Chamber Orchestra conducted by Tan Dun.</plot></episodedetails>
