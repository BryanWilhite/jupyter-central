<episodedetails><title>Tokyo's Islands Niijima and Hachijojima</title><plot>A cycle tour of two remote islands that lie within Tokyo's city limits. On Niijima, we see homes built with a hard volcanic rock called Koga stone, which is also used to make glass art. Locals still carefully tend the graves of exiles banished here during samurai times, who brought education to the island. On Hachijojima, an ancient textile tradition creates complex, subtle patterns using only three colors of plant-dyed yarn. We also sample island food and learn about a much loved local newspaper.</plot></episodedetails>
