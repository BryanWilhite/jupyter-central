However, when the spell makes everything Gaz eat taste like pork, Gaz threatens to destroy him if he doesnâ€™t help her get back to normal. All their father could do was put Gaz in a cage and treat her like a freak so Dib goes off to ask the Swollen Eyeball Network if they have any advice on the situation; there is only one way Gaz can get her sense of taste restored: she must travel to an alternate dimension and get The Pork King to return her back to normal.</plot></episodedetails>
